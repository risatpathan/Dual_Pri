\title{Schedulability Analysis for Dual Priority Scheduling}  
\maketitle  


% According to Baruah (2003, Dynamic- and Static-priority Scheduling of Recurring Real-time Tasks, Theorem~3), $\tau_i$ is schedulable on a single processor using static priority if and only if for each absolute deadline of a job  $d_{i,k}$ where $k\in N$, there exists an interval $d_{i,k-1}\leq t'\leq d_{i,k}$ for which the following condition holds:
% \begin{equation}
% dbf(\tau_i,t)+\sum_{\tau_j\in\{hp_i\}}rbf_i(\tau_j,t')\leq t'	
% \end{equation} 

% Here the demand bound function captures the maximum execution demand of $\tau_i$ for a time interval length $t$ if it is to meet all deadlines.
% \begin{equation}
% dbf(\tau_i,t)=\left(\lfloor \frac{t-D_i}{T_i}\rfloor+1\right)\times C_i
% \end{equation} 


% On the other hand, the request bound function  $rbf_i(\tau_j,t')$ denotes the maximum amount of time for which $\tau_j$ could \textbf{deny the processor} to lower priority task $\tau_i$ over some interval length of $t'$. \\\\



\section{Dual Priority}
Given a task system $\tau=\{\tau_1,\tau_2,\ldots, \tau_n\}$, we first make the following \textbf{assumptions}:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Each task  $\tau_i$ has a original priority $n+i$ and a promotion priority $i$.
	\item Each task has a fixed promotion point $p_i$. The concerned job $J_{i,k}$ has its promotion point $P_i=r_{i,k}+p_i$.
\end{enumerate}

\my{
\begin{lemma}[Worst Case  Pattern]
\label{lemma:pattern}
Suppose $\tau$ could experience deadline miss with the current priority and promotion point  assignment, then it must be that there exists a busy time interval $[0,t]$  during  which some job of task $\tau_i\in\tau$ would miss its deadline when all other tasks  release their first job at time instant $0$, and all jobs including those released by $\tau_i$ are released as soon as possible with corresponding period.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Among all possible legal event sequences in which $\tau$ misses some deadline,  let $S$ denote such a sequence where some job of $\tau_i\in \tau$  misses its deadline within the shortest busy interval $[0,t_F]$.  As a result no deadline miss would happens earlier than $t_F$. 

Assuming in the event sequence $S$, there exists some tasks, e.g.,  $\tau_j$ whose first release is not at time instant $0$ and the separation between some job release is greater than  $T_j$. Then as we shift $r_{j,1}$ to $0$ and reduce  time separation  between each job releases to $T_j$, $\tau_i$ would consume no more resource than before.

This is because that all jobs of $\tau_j$ with deadline before $t$ would still meet its deadline (otherwise we can construct a new sequence $S$), while the last job of $\tau_j$ released before $t$ (e.g., $J_{j,m}$) is more likely to  deny processor from $\tau_i$ since the promotion point of job $J_{j,m}$ will also decrease. Therefore after we modify the release pattern of $\tau_j$, $\tau_i$ would still misses its deadline. Finally by repeating the above steps for all such tasks, the deadline miss of $\tau_i$ would still happen at $t_F$. Therefore Lemma 1 is true.
\end{proof}

  \label{fig:case2}
\end{figure}
From Lemma~\ref{lemma:pattern} we know that if $\tau$ would  experience some deadline miss, then there exists a $\tau_i$ that will have its  deadline miss with the worst case release pattern defined in Lemma~\ref{lemma:pattern}. Therefore the following corollary can tell us whether a task system $\tau$ is schedulable by the dual priority scheduling algorithm.

\begin{corollary}
\label{corollary:condition}
If  $\forall \tau_i\in \tau$ no deadline miss happens for all possible time interval length $t$ with the worst case release pattern:  1) some job of $\tau_i$ has deadline at $t$  and all jobs of $\tau_i$ are released as soon as possible  with period $T_i$; 2) first job of $\tau_j\in \tau-\tau_i$ is released at $0$ and all jobs are released as soon as possible with period $T_j$, then $\tau$ is schedulable by the dual priority scheduling algorithm.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
This corollary is a direct deduction from Lemma~\ref{lemma:pattern}.
\end{proof}


From Corollary~\ref{corollary:condition}, we know  that as along as we can guarantee that $\forall~\tau_i\in \tau:~\forall~t:$ no deadline miss happens with the worst case release pattern,  then we can declare that the task system $\tau$ is schedulable by the dual priority scheduling algorithm. Therefore  in the simplest case,  an exact but computational expensive schedulability test for dual priority scheduling algorithm could be derived by simulating the behavior of the system with the worst case release pattern. 


To reduce the complexity, we need a more efficient test to determine whether $\tau_i\in\tau$ is schedulable when jobs are released with the worst case release in Lemma~\ref{lemma:pattern}. Let $ibf_i(\tau-\tau_i,t')$ (ibf is short for interference bound function) denote maximum possible resource consumed by all other tasks in the system except $\tau_i$ during the time interval $[0,t']$, and let $dbf(\tau_i,t)$ denotes the maximum execution requirement of $\tau_i$ during $[0,t]$,  when all tasks are released with worst case pattern in Lemma~\ref{lemma:pattern}.\footnote{Note that we only need to concern about the worst case release pattern of the two functions.}  Therefore the following theorem can be used to determine whether $\tau_i\in \tau$ is schedulable when all jobs in the system is released in the worst case release pattern.
}
\begin{theorem}
$\tau_i$ would not experience any deadline miss with the worst case release pattern on a single processor by the dual priority scheduling algorithm if the following condition holds:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1}
\forall~t~:\exists~t':~dbf(\tau_i,t)+ibf_i(\tau-\tau_i,t')\leq t'
\end{equation} 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We can prove the statement that if $\tau_i$ is not schedulable with the worst case release pattern, then Equation~\ref{eq:1} would not hold. Suppose that $\tau_i$ is not schedulable then there are legal event sequences in which $\tau_i$ misses some deadline when $\tau_i$ is assigned with the current priority and promotion point. Let $S'$ denote such a sequence where $\tau_i$ misses deadline at the earliest time at $t$.

It must be the cases that during $[0,t]$ some tasks are executing because otherwise the time interval between the last idle instant to $t$ could also construct such a sequence. Then it must be that during the time interval $[0,t']~(\forall t')$, other tasks have consumed an amount of resource more than 
\[
ibf_i(\tau-\tau_i,t')>t'-dbf(\tau_i,t)
\]
which contradicts the Equation~\ref{eq:1}.
\end{proof}








% \my{Existing request bound function  $rbf_i(\tau_j,t')$  denotes the maximum cumulative execution requirement by jobs of $\tau_j$ by $t'$ that have ready times within any time interval of duration $t'$.  However this is not the case in dual priority scheduling as shown in the following example.}

% \begin{example}
% As shown in the Figure~1, when $r_i\leq t'\leq P_i$, the execution requirement of $J_{j,k}$ is $C_j$ because $\tau_i$  would execute only after $J_{j,k}$ finishes. However, when $P_i\leq t'\leq P_j$,  the time $J_{j,k}$ deny processor from $\tau_i$ is equal the time that $J_{j,k}$ has already executed, because $\tau_i$ has higher priority than $\tau_j$ during $[P_i,P_j]$.  This is a significantly different from the  static priority scheduling.
% \begin{figure}[h!]
%  \centering
% \includegraphics[scale=1]{Figure/E1}  
% \caption{Example One}
%   \label{fig:p3}
% \end{figure}
% \end{example}

% Unfortunately, it is hard to calculate the exact time that  $J_{j,k}$  has executed, and therefore here instead,  we would use an upper bound of the resource $J_{i,k}$ has consumed to derive the test.






% For dual priority scheduling, then we can have the following theorem.
% \begin{theorem}
% In dual priority scheduling, $\tau_i$ is schedulable on a single processor if  the following condition holds:
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:1}
% \forall t~:\exists t':dbf(\tau_i,t)+\sum_{\tau_j\in\{\tau-\tau_j\}}rbf_i(\tau_j,t')\leq t'
% \end{equation} 
% where $rbf_i(\tau_j,t')$ upper bounds the resource that $\tau_j$ has consumed by $t'$ with corresponding priority and promotion point.
% \end{theorem}
% \begin{proof}
% We can prove the statement that if $\tau_i$ is not schedulable then Equation~\ref{eq:1} would not hold. Suppose that $\tau_i$ is not schedulable then there are legal event sequences in which $\tau_i$ misses some deadline when $\tau_i$ is assigned with the current priority and promotion point. Let $S'$ denote such a sequence where $\tau_i$ misses deadline at the earliest time at $t$ (no deadline misses happens earlier).

% It must be the cases that during $[0,t]$ some tasks are executing because otherwise the time interval between the last idle instant to $t$ could also construct such a sequence. Then it must be that during the time interval $[0,t']~(\forall t')$, other tasks have consumed an amount of resource more than 
% \[
% \sum_{\tau_j\in\{\tau-\tau_j\}}rbf_i(\tau_j,t')>t'-dbf(\tau_i,t)\Rightarrow dbf(\tau_i,t)>\max_{t'}(t'-\sum_{\tau_j\in\{\tau-\tau_j\}}rbf_i(\tau_j,t'))
% \]
% which contradicts the Equation~\ref{eq:1}.
% \end{proof}

% \begin{lemma}[Worst Case Pattern]
% For a fixed $t$ and $t'$,  $\tau_j\in\{\tau-\tau_i\}$  can consume maximum resource during $[0,t']$, and hence $\tau_i$ can receive minimal resource by $t'$ when it is first released at $0$ and all jobs are released as soon as possible with period $T_i$. 
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}
% Suppose there is no deadline miss happens earlier, and as we shift the release pattern of $\tau_j$ left, $J_{j,1}$ will no longer request for any resource while the increment of the resource consumed by other jobs of $\tau_j$ is bounded by $C_j$. On the other hand, as we shift the pattern right, the promotion point of $J_{j,k}$  increases and hence $J_{j,k}$ is less likely to has higher priority than $\tau_i$ (and hence consume the resource).
% \end{proof}

% \section{Schedulability Test}
% \begin{theorem}
% A task system $\tau$ is schedulable by dual priority scheduling if the following hold:
% \begin{equation}
% \forall \tau_i\in \tau, t: \exists t':
% dbf(\tau_i,t)+\sum_{\tau_j\in\{\tau-\tau_j\}}rbf_i(\tau_j,t')\leq t'
% \end{equation}
% \end{theorem}

% Here we also derive $rbf_{i}^1(\tau_j,t')$ which denotes \ae{maximum possible} execution that $\tau_j$ has received after $r_i$,  and $rbf_{i}^2(\tau_j,t')$ which denotes \ae{maximum possible} execution  that $\tau_j$ has received after $P_i$ (if $t'>P_i$).  Assuming no deadline miss happens earlier, the total execution before $r_i$ and $P_i$ should not exceed $r_i$ and $P_i$, respectively. As a result, we are able to tighten the schedulability test by bounding the total execution before $r_i$ and $P_i$ by $r_i$ and $P_i$, respectively.

% We can bound the total execution before $r_i$ or $P_i$ (if $t'>P_i$) by $r_i$ or $P_i$, respectively. For $\tau_i$ itself, we simply assume its execution demand after $r_i$ and $P_i$ is $C_j$.

% \begin{equation}
% F_1(\tau_i,t,t')=\min\left(r_i,n_i\times C_i+\sum_{\tau_j\in\{\tau-\tau_i\}}rbf_i(\tau_j,t')-rbf_{i}^1(\tau_j,t')\right)+\sum_{\tau_j\in\{\tau-\tau_i\}}rbf_{i}^1(\tau_j,t')+C_i
% \end{equation}


% \begin{equation}
% F_2(\tau_i,t,t')=\min\left(P_i,n_i\times C_i+\sum_{\tau_j\in\{\tau-\tau_i\}}rbf_i(\tau_j,t')-rbf_{i}^2(\tau_j,t')\right)+\sum_{\tau_j\in\{\tau-\tau_i\}}rbf_{i}^2(\tau_j,t')+C_i

% We can derive a simple upper bound of $t$. Suppose that
